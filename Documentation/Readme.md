## Statement of work

- Vuepress now has a limitation for the nav depth. It does not support nested sidebar thus some sections cannot be further organized. 
- We want to improve the current Vuepress site layout to be a standard three column layout supporting better navigation experience. 
- Many other functions are wanted but not available on the site now. For example, social functions like Share, Feedback, and more importantly the ability to generate a PDF file automatically. 
- Considering the growth of the community, multilingual support will be wanted for Zowe docs in the near future.
