### Jekyll vs Hugo vs Gatsby: 
- Detailed comparison: (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-jekyll-vs-hugo/)

### Jekyll (Ruby): 
- Simple, easy to learn, rich theme library
- But, no graphical user interface by default
- Long compilation time, needs ruby environment
- Kubernetes migrated to Hugo because they found Jekyll does not support multi-language so well. 

### Hugo (Go)
- Fast, versatile, Multilingual/il8n
- But confusing template syntax, doesnâ€™t have plugin support

### Gatsby - (React + Graphql)
- Extremely Fast
- Plenty of themes, plugins
- Modern JavaScript syntax
- But, has a learning curve involved.

### Next.js/ Nuxt.js (React/Vue)
- Server side rendering React
- Better SEO

### Docusaurus vs Gatsby
- Gatsby is way more flexible and modular
- Many Docusaurus features are inspired by Gatsby itself. But Docusaurus is specially designed for documentation sites - that come with library versioning, translations and many more.
- Gatsby is a framework and Docusaurus is a product
